# Dumbz - Cheatsheets

This school project was done by four developers and me in the Wild Code School (Bordeaux). We use the Simple MVC structure: https://github.com/WildCodeSchool/simple-mvc.

## Description

A web application providing cheatsheets to web developers, with different categories, an identification process, storage in a database and so on.
It was very interesting working with agile methods and combining our efforts to make something very neat in only a couple of weeks.
We have done this app with only 2 months of courses.
